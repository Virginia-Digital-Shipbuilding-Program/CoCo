# Coastal Coders

Coastal Coders is a simulation-based learning platform to assist exploration of K-12 Virginia computer science strands and standards via engaging and thematic challenges.

Users are tasked to navigate computational thinking skills such as decomposition, pattern recognition, algorithmic design, and abstraction as computer science content is expanded upon in each activity or mini-game. Each activity ties computer science connections to uses of innovative, digital technologies.

During gameplay, users navigate real-world activities and challenges while collecting digital tools to assist with in-game problem-solving. Users additionally learn about corresponding STEM careers in computer science with diverse career pathways.
